<p>An <i>interval</i> is a pair (A, B) of integers such that A = B. Two intervals (A, B) and (C, D) <i>overlap</i> if there exists an integer L such that A = L = B and C = L = D. Intervals that do not overlap are called <i>disjoint</i>. The <i>union</i> of intervals (A, B) and (C, D) is defined as:</p>
<blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>either a single interval (<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">min</tt>(A, C), <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">max</tt>(B, D)), when (A, B) and (C, D) overlap, or</li>
<li>the intervals (A, B) and (C, D) themselves, when they are disjoint.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>Taking the union of two intervals is a commutative and associative operation, so it can be extended to an arbitrary number of intervals.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following eight intervals:</p>
<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">  ( 1,  5)    (12, 15)     (42, 44)
  (70, 72)    (36, 36)     (-4,  2)
  (43, 69)    (15, 24)</tt>
<p>Intervals (1, 5) and (-4, 2) overlap and their union is (-4, 5). Intervals (12, 15) and (15, 24) overlap and their union is (12, 24). Intervals (42, 44) and (43, 69) overlap and their union is (42, 69). Intervals (70, 72) and (36, 36) are disjoint and do not overlap with other intervals. The union of all eight intervals consists of the following five pairwise disjoint intervals:</p>
<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">  (-4,  5)    (12, 24)    (42, 69)
  (70, 72)    (36, 36)</tt>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<blockquote><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>def solution(A, B)</tt></p></blockquote>
<p>that, given two arrays A and B consisting of N elements each, returns the number of pairwise disjoint intervals constituting the union of N intervals described by arrays A and B. The K-th interval, where K is an integer within the range [0..(N - 1)], is defined as (A[K], B[K]).</p>
<p>For example, given the following arrays A and B consisting of eight elements each:</p>
<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">  A[0] =  1    A[1] = 12    A[2] = 42
  A[3] = 70    A[4] = 36    A[5] = -4
  A[6] = 43    A[7] = 15

  B[0] =  5    B[1] = 15    B[2] = 44
  B[3] = 72    B[4] = 36    B[5] =  2
  B[6] = 69    B[7] = 24</tt>
<p>the function should return 5, because the intervals described by these arrays correspond to the example above.</p>
<p>Write an <b><b>efficient</b></b> algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
<blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];</li>
<li>each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [<span class="number">-1,000,000,000</span>..<span class="number">1,000,000,000</span>];</li>
<li>A[K] = B[K] for integers K within the range [0..(N - 1)].</li>
</ul>
